# musescore4-CS-converter
Purpose of this script is to convert sheet note material in .mxl format generated by [Musescore 4](https://musescore.org/) to be used readily by [Cinematic Studio series orchestral libraries](https://cinematicstudioseries.com/). Although Musescore team did a great job with their Muse Sounds libraries (especially for being free to use!), they are still lacking in many points. I love to use Musescore 4 to compose. However, sound-wise I like Cinematic Studio libraries way more. Point is to make conversion between Musescore 4 to CS libraries as fast and streamlined as possible.

This script is made for [Reaper DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/).
