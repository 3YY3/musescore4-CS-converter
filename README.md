# musescore4-CS-converter
Purpose of this tool is to convert sheet note material in .mxl format generated by [Musescore 4](https://musescore.org/) to be used readily by [Cinematic Studio series orchestral libraries](https://cinematicstudioseries.com/) with the help of [REAticulate](https://reaticulate.com/). Although Musescore team did a great job with their Muse Sounds libraries (especially for being free to use!), they are still lacking in many points. I love to use Musescore 4 to compose. However, sound-wise I like Cinematic Studio libraries way more. Point is to make conversion between Musescore 4 to CS libraries as fast and streamlined as possible.

This script is made for [Reaper DAW](https://www.reaper.fm/).

This repository contains three main parts:
- Lua script for converting of .mxl files
- Reaticulate reabank file containing articulation options for CS libraries (as well as Spitfire Originals Epic Choir and Cinesamples Cineharp which are not concerning for the lua script at the moment)
- My orchestral template (not necessary, although it already has -60 ms offset on every CS MIDI track - if you decide not to use this template you need to set this offset on your track!)

# What is does?
Almost everything necessary! Here is how it works:
1. Compose something in Musescore 4,
2. export .mxl files for every instrument/section,
3. import them in the Reaper,
4. in each .mxl item set articulations via REAticulate according to your work in Musescore (first click on the note at which an articulation is changed and then select from REAticulate menu - articulation change must correspong with a note in order to work),
5. then you set velocities for long articulations (this tool enables you to use all legato variants CS libraries offer without hassle!),
6. run the script,
7. and that's it!

What happens next? Well...
- Lua script will convert dynamics from .mxl notation events into CC1 (not only p, pp, fff, etc. values but also crescendos and diminuendos - as long as they are done properly in Musescore)
- Applies offset to legato notes so that they sound straight in beat
- Sets CC64 values so you make use of rebow/retongue samples in CS libraries
- Converts CC1 values of short artiulation notes to their velocity (you don't need to mess up with velocities for short articulations anymore!)
- Moves REAticulate events together with changes done to legato articulation notes
